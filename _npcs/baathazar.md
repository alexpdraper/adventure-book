> Greetings, I am Baathazar, the Scorned by Love Many Times, and servant to Chethrazar, Who is Wreathed in Flames. Please state your name and your greatest fear.
>
> In accordance with Yuulzu’s Infernal Bargains and the Devilish Rites Pact you, Ernst Worman (the **Pactmaker**), hereby offer your soul in exchange for limited access to the fiendish power of Chethrazar, Who is Wreathed in Flame (the **Patron**). The **Pactmaker** will gain the ability to cast powerful magical spells fueled by the **Patron** on a limited, temporary basis, which power the **Pactmaker** is hereby irrevocably obligated to utilize to the satisfaction of the **Patron** per section 813(k) of the Oath of Obnooviatt. Notwithstanding subsection 31(b)(iii) of the Warlock’s Act, the **Pactmaker** will be able to cast available spells at will, within the limits setout in the **Patron**’s Manifesto, or as per the **Patron**’s whims as may be adjusted from time to time as the **Patron** so chooses—though generally not to be adjusted more than multiple times in a day. Notwithstanding the **Patron**’s choosing to refrain from adjusting the parameters of the bargain (including, but not limited to, any adjustments described in the foregoing), the **Patron** retains the sole right to allow the **Pactmaker** access to greater or lesser spells and abilities as the **Patron** sees fit—regardless of whether or not the **Pactmaker** desires said access; further, should the **Pactmaker** fail to control the **Patron**’s awesome power, the **Pactmaker** will retain said power if such remains as the will of the **Patron**, without prejudice or concern for the will of the **Pactmaker**.
>
> In connection with the foregoing, Baathazar will, from time to time, and per the will of the **Patron**, be concomitant with the **Pactmaker** and ensure the foregoing remains in force.
