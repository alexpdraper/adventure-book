## Occupation & history

Champion of the Great War, High Priestess of the Church of Lilia, and Queen of Felvand, Arrietty is beloved and revered by her people. She soars over the land astride her faithful companion, the Silver Dragon Sydra, visiting the people of her kingdom personally.

As loved as she is by her people she is feared by her enemies. She is known as a fierce warrior, who strikes in harmony with the majestic Sydra.

Despite her role, Arrietty feels herself a prisoner in Felvand. While still a child she and her sister Sydra were playing on the ice when it cracked and Sydra fell through. Arrietty rushed to save her and was pulled in after her. As she was about to succumb to the cold she felt a warming presence surround her. A voice came into her mind.

“Your time is not yet come. The world needs you. Will you aid me in its protection?” Arrietty gasped and realized she was able to breathe. She looked at her sister, whose hand she was still holding. Sydra appeared to still be drowning.

“I will save her,” said the voice. Arrietty nodded. Instantly she felt something beneath her pushing her to the surface. When she broke through the water she was somewhere she had never been before. She was in Felvand.

## Appearance

Arrietty is a fair-skinned high elf with long silver hair. Her right eye is silver, and her left eye is green. She is regularly dressed in silvery-white attire. She fights with a longbow and rapier.

## Talent

Arrietty is a gifted artist. She keeps her memories of home alive through her paintings, which she shares only with Sydra.

## Mannerism

Absentmindedly twirls her long silvery hair.

## Interactions with others

Arrietty is affable and easily endears herself to others. She is absentminded and easily distracted when she isn’t putting effort into focusing.

## Useful knowledge

Arrietty knows a lot. Pretty much all of the secrets.

## Ideal

Arrietty loves beauty and the people of Felvand, however, she seeks more than anything to regain her childhood. She wishes to be free of her role as Queen, and to escape Felvand altogether and return to her family in the natural world.

## Bond

Arrietty’s strongest bonds are with Sydra and Arden.

## Flaws and secrets

While Arrietty is loved by her people, she has become an absent leader. Her focus is singular, she is trying to return home, and is willing to make sacrifices to do so, even to the detriment of Felvand.
