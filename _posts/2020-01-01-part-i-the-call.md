## Part 1 <small>To Felvand</small>

### Jubilant & Robyn

Jubilant and his loyal pup Robyn are doing normal every day stuff, when Jubilant encounters some strange weeds in the forest. The weeds seem to seek the darkness, and wither in the light, and the plants around them are dead.

  - Meets the Giant Elk
  - Talks to a Dryad
  - Visits a grove and discovers it’s completely defiled and dead

### Orithia

Orithia is on an assignment. She spends days tracking and observing Jubilant in the forest. She is conflicted about her assignment, but intends to go through with it when she is attacked by several blights.

  - Follows Jubilant around

### Ernst Worman

Ernst is living his life as a good simple man. He loves his ranch animals and is a model citizen. On a regular day out and about, he is accosted by some of the local ruffians. The ruffians attempt to rough him up, but he is protected by a strange magical power. He hears a voice in his head:

> Ernst, what is it you seek? Your world has betrayed and abandoned you. You wish to change your Earth, but you lack the power to do so. Let me be your power.

A giant tree springs out of the ground in front of Ernst. A crack at the base of the tree grows to the size of a door, and through it, Ernst sees a thick forest.

The voice speaks again:

> Come to my world. Sow wonder and greatness.

### Winchester

Just as Winchester adjusts to his life in the Natural world, he happens upon a giant tree, with a portal to Felvand at its base.

### Simon Curie

A hapless nerd and good friend of Winchester.

## Part 2 <small>Strange Plants</small>

Winchester, Wizard, and Ernst enter Felvand to find Jubilant and Orithia locked in combat with an army of blights.

The party is fighting blights at the base of a giant, cursed tree. On its turn the tree may summon an additional blight.

  - Twig Blight (x2)
  - Needle Blight (x1)
  - Vine Blight (x1)
  - Cursed Tree (x1)

### Cursed Tree

A large, evil tree that summons blights. It is noticeably corrupted.

  - **Armor Class** 10
  - **Hit Points** 39 (6d8 + 12)
  - **Speed** 0

#### Actions

  - **Spread Blight (Recharge 5–6)**. The Cursed Tree corrupts nearby plants, creating a blight within 15 ft.
  - **Harden**. AC increases by 5 for 1 turn.

### 2.1 <small>After the battle</small>

The party can gain some knowledge from investigating the tree (using an investigate, nature, or arcana check).

  - **DC 5** The tree was corrupted by dark magic.
  - **DC 10** The dark magic’s source is necromantic.
  - **DC 15** About the base of the tree and within the soil is a strange black powder that doesn’t seem to belong there.

At the end of the battle, Ernst hears the voice of his patron speak to him. “Burn it down.”

> You raise your hand and stretch it toward the giant tree. You feel a growing heat spread from your core throughout your entire body. The heat continues to grow until you nearly black out, when it suddenly rushes to your hand and a fiery inferno bursts out toward the tree. The tree erupts into flame and burns at an unnatural speed.

Each creature within 15 ft. of the tree makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures that fail the save are also knocked prone.
