The party arrives in the town of Marinville, meaning to share their findings with the townsfolk, but are met with more trouble. Meanwhile, [Ernst](/characters/ernst) has a meeting with [Chethrazar](/npcs/chethrazar) in his mind.

## Pactmaking

Ernst wakes up in his bed surrounded by a sea of flames. [Baathazar](/npcs/baathazar) stands at the foot of his bed.

> Greetings, I am Baathazar, the Scorned by Love Many Times, and servant to Chethrazar, Who is Wreathed in Flames. Please state your name and your greatest fear.
>
> In accordance with Yuulzu’s Infernal Bargains and the Devilish Rites Pact you, Ernst Worman (the **Pactmaker**), hereby offer your soul in exchange for limited access to the fiendish power of Chethrazar, Who is Wreathed in Flame (the **Patron**). The **Pactmaker** will gain the ability to cast powerful magical spells fueled by the **Patron** on a limited, temporary basis, which power the **Pactmaker** is hereby irrevocably obligated to utilize to the satisfaction of the **Patron** per section 813(k) of the Oath of Obnooviatt. Notwithstanding subsection 31(b)(iii) of the Warlock’s Act, the **Pactmaker** will be able to cast available spells at will, within the limits setout in the **Patron**’s Manifesto, or as per the **Patron**’s whims as may be adjusted from time to time as the **Patron** so chooses—though generally not to be adjusted more than multiple times in a day. Notwithstanding the **Patron**’s choosing to refrain from adjusting the parameters of the bargain (including, but not limited to, any adjustments described in the foregoing), the **Patron** retains the sole right to allow the **Pactmaker** access to greater or lesser spells and abilities as the **Patron** sees fit—regardless of whether or not the **Pactmaker** desires said access; further, should the **Pactmaker** fail to control the **Patron**’s awesome power, the **Pactmaker** will retain said power if such remains as the will of the **Patron**, without prejudice or concern for the will of the **Pactmaker**.
>
> In connection with the foregoing, Baathazar will, from time to time, and per the will of the **Patron**, be concomitant with the **Pactmaker** and ensure the foregoing remains in force.

## Scarecrow battle

The fields outside of town have been overrun with violent, undead scarecrows! [Captain Diena](/npcs/diena) and [Lucan Venga](/characters/lucan) join the party in battle against them.

The party can fight off the monsters, or attempt to enter town and shut the scarecrows out. Towards the end of the fight, [Naktis](/npcs/naktis) appears as a hooded figure and tries to attack Diena. Diena rushes the party into town.

## The town of Marinville

Marinville was once a lively fishing town, but has fallen on hard times. The fields outside town have been made desolate by hordes of undead coming from the forest. The beach has been fortified with spiked logs.

Captain Diena lets the party know that the town has been struggling. The people are low on food. The crops and most of their fishing boats have been destroyed. Diena sent an envoy to a neighbouring town with a request for supplies, but hasn’t heard back. Additionally, the mayor has failed to take any meaningful action. He’s been focused on suring up the keep, and refuses most meetings.

### Visiting Mayor Lom

[Mayor Lom](/npcs/mayor-lom)’s keep is completely fenced off, and the gate is watched by two [guards](/monsters/guard) (Kison and Fan). A [knight](/monsters/knight) (Cerin) can open the gate from the inside.

> You march up the path to the castle. The castle is large, opulent, and ominously quiet. The main hall is illuminated by a grand chandelier with at least 30 candles. You ascend a red-carpeted staircase towards the throne room. At the top of the stairs you see a pair of large, heavy doors. You smell roasted vegetables and meat coming through the doors.

A man is seated at a large dining table, adorned with food, eating alone, with a servant standing nearby.

Mayor Lom is not excited to see the party, but tries to hide it (party’s insight vs. Lom’s deception).

#### Enemies

If a battle ensues, the suits of armor in the throne room come to life and protect Lom.

### The missing caravan

If the party goes to look for the missing caravan they find it surrounded by dead, shadowless bodies.
