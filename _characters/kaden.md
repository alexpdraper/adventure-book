      - title: Divine Sense
        description: |
          The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow spell.

          You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.

      - title: Lay on Hands
        description: |
          Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level x 5.

          As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.

          Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.

          This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.

        description: |
          While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
      - title: Spellcasting
      - title: Divine Smite
        description: Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend.
      - title: Divine Health
        description: By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.
      - title: Sacred Oath (Oath of the Ancients)
        description: |
          When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose an oath, such as the Oath of Devotion.

          Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.

          Oath Spells

          Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

          If you gain an oath spell that doesn't appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.

          Channel Divinity

          Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.

          When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.

          Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.
      - title: Extra Attack
        description: Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
      - title: Aura of Protection
        description: |
          Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus.

          At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
      - title: Aura of Courage
        description: |
          Starting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can't be frightened while you are conscious.

          At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
      - title: Improved Divine Smite
        description: By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage. If you also use your Divine Smite with an attack, you add this damage to the extra damage of your Divine Smite.
      - title: Oath Spells
      - title: Channel Divinity
        description: |
          When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.

          **Nature’s Wrath**. You can use your Channel Divinity to invoke primeval forces to ensnare a foe. As an action, you can cause spectral vines to spring up and reach for a creature within 10 feet of you that you can see.
          The creature must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (its choice) or be restrained. While restrained by the vines, the creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, it frees itself and the vines vanish.

          **Turn the Faithless**. You can use your Channel Divinity to utter ancient words that are painful for fey and fiends to hear. As an action, you present your holy symbol, and each fey or fiend within 30 feet of you that can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.
          A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can only use the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.
          If the creature’s true form is concealed by an illusion, shapeshifting, or other effect, that form is revealed while it is turned.

      - title: Aura of Warding
        description: |
          Beginning at 7th level, ancient magic lies so heavily upon you that it forms an eldritch ward. You and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have resistance to damage from spells.

          At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

    features:
      - title: Bardic Inspiration (d6)
        description: |
          You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.

          Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.

          You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

          Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.

      description: |
        Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and thick layers of padding underneath the armour. Buckles and straps distribute the weight over the body.

        Anytime I am hit with a melee attack while wearing the armour, the attacker makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. They take 1d4 damage on a failed save, and half that on a success.

        If I die wearing the armour, I am revived to half health, but the magical fire of the armour is burnt away.
